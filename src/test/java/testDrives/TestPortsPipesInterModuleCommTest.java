/**
 * Test drive class for testing of the inter-module communication via ports and pipes.
 * This test drive class creates three instances of three modules (one per module),
 * which will be inter-connected via I/O-ports and I/O-pipes. 
 * The first module will read data from a specified testing folder
 * and pass that information to the second. The second module will modify that data and
 * send it to the third which will in return write the data to the hard disk.
 * The following classes will be tested:
 * @see core.common.Pipe
 * @see core.common.Port
 * @see core.common.InputPort
 * @see core.common.OutputPort
