Hello this is the test file "testFile1.txt".
This fill will serve das a file to be tested.
I have to write some stuff into this file so that it 
will exceed the committed buffersize of 1024 characters.
Hmm this may take some more time than I initally anticipated.
But Anyhow let's continue to write some weird stuff into this file.
Did you recognize how continously the size of each sentence increases?
Fascinating isn't it?
Oh well, there goes the symmetry.
How sad.
Sad indeed.
Or maybe not.
I don't know yet.
But maybe it will increase again.
But for what reason and what extend?
That is a very good question which I dare to answer here:
Long long (not integer) ago there was a shining beautiful steed
which was called Karl. It out-shone (it is a real word!) all the other
steeds which were next to it, eventhough they ready did not give a damn.
And so in its very limited wisdom it spontaneously decided to tell its story.

HAH! more than 1024 characters! DONE!
Ah to make this story complete: Hello World!
